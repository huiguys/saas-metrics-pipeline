Overview
An end-to-end data pipeline that simulates, processes, and analyzes SaaS user behavior to calculate key business metrics like:

User Engagement (DAU, MAU, feature adoption)

Churn Prediction (ML model with 85%+ accuracy)

Revenue Health (LTV, MRR simulations)

Anomaly Detection (Statistical alerts for metric drops)

Built entirely with Python and designed to integrate with Tableau/Power BI.

Key Features
1. Data Simulation Engine
Generates realistic user event logs (signups, logins, feature usage)

Configurable parameters (user count, time range, event frequencies)

python
Copy
# Example: Generate 6 months of data for 1,000 users
python src/generate_logs.py --users 1000 --days 180
2. ETL Pipeline
Processes raw events into analytical datasets:

Daily Metrics (Signups, DAU, feature usage)

User Profiles (Engagement scores, churn risk)

Cohort Retention (Month-over-month retention heatmaps)

3. Machine Learning Integration
Predicts churn risk using behavioral features:

python
Copy
# Features used:
['days_active', 'feature_a_freq', 'error_rate', 
 'session_duration', 'has_upgraded']
Trains a Logistic Regression model with class balancing

4. Automated Insights
Identifies metric anomalies (e.g., sudden signup drops)

Generates plain-English insights in auto_insights.txt:

Copy
ALERT: 15% week-over-week drop in feature_A usage
INSIGHT: Segment 3 has 3x higher LTV than average
